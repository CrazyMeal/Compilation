JSONGrabber
===========

This is an example project using json-simple library.

In this example I am parsing datas from Open Datas from Strasbourg about parkings occupation.
We first grab datas from 2 different urls then we merge them to get a unique map with all information. Used this project to then use the library in Mobistras project.
